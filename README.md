# Homework-06-Weather-Dashboard

## My Task 
The goal was to build a weather dashboard tht allows the user to search for a city in order to see the current weather, as well as a 5 day forecast. The user's search history is saved & rendered on the screen, and it's possible to click on a city to view it's weather information again.
